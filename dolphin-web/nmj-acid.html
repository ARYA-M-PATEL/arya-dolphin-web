                        <h3 class="acid-name mt-5 mb-2">Storage Notes :</h3>
                        <p>
                            1 .Container: Store N-Methyl J-Acid in a tightly sealed container to prevent exposure to air
                            and moisture, which can degrade its quality. <br>
                            2 .Environment: Keep in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and heat sources. <br>
                            3 .Compatibility: Avoid storing near incompatible chemicals to prevent reactions that could
                            compromise its stability. <br>
                            4 .Ventilation: Ensure adequate ventilation in the storage area to prevent the buildup of
                            any
                            fumes or gases that may be released. <br>
                            5 .Handling: Use appropriate personal protective equipment, including gloves and goggles,
                            when
                            handling N-Methyl J-Acid to prevent skin and eye contact. <br>
                            6 .Labeling: Clearly label the container with the name of the chemical, hazard warnings, and
                            any other relevant information for safe handling and storage. <br>
                            7 .First Aid: Have a designated first aid kit and procedures in place in case of accidental
                            exposure to N-Methyl J-Acid, and ensure all personnel are trained in its proper use. <br>
                            8 .Security: Store N-Methyl J-Acid in a secure location to prevent unauthorized access or
                            tampering, especially in facilities where security is a concern.<br>
