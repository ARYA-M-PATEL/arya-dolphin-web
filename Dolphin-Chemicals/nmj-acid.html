                    <h5 class="title fw-800 mt-5 mb-2">Storage Notes :</h5>
                    <p>
                        1 .Container: Store N-Methyl J-Acid in a tightly
                                sealed container to prevent exposure to air
                                and moisture, which can degrade its quality.
                                <br>
                                2 .Environment: Keep in a cool, dry place away
                                from direct sunlight and heat sources. <br>
                                3 .Compatibility: Avoid storing near
                                incompatible chemicals to prevent reactions that
                                could
                                compromise its stability. <br>

                                6 .Labeling: Clearly label the container with
                                the name of the chemical, hazard warnings, and
                                any other relevant information for safe handling
                                and storage. <br>
                                7 .First Aid: Have a designated first aid kit
                                and procedures in place in case of accidental
                                exposure to N-Methyl J-Acid, and ensure all
                                personnel are trained in its proper use. <br>
                                8 .Security: Store N-Methyl J-Acid in a secure
                                location to prevent unauthorized access or
                                tampering, especially in facilities where
                                security is a concern.<br>
